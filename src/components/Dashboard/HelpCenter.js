          You can view how many Surprise Bags you have for sale, and how many of
          those bags have been reserved by customers, on the Dashboard page. The
          large number indicates the number of available Surprise Bags that have
          not been reserved yet. Below this number you can see the total number
          of Surprise Bags for sale in the current sales window. Should you wish
          to change the amount of available Surprise Bags for sale, you can
          adjust the amount using the plus and minus buttons. You can see when
          the day's sales close and when the Surprise Bags are being picked up
          by customers under 'sale and collection status'. The collection time
          can be adjusted by clicking on the pencil. Please remember that
          changes made on the Dashboard page only apply to the current sales
          window. If you wish to make permanent changes to the number of
          Surprise Bags and collection times you need to use the weekly
          Schedule.
